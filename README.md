The api I developed with Python has 2 end points and uses port 8000. (http://127.0.0.1:8080) The results come in json.

http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather i used its API.

GET /

GET /temperature/city/{canakkale}

I have performed Task 1, Task 2 and Task 3. I dockerized the structure with dockerfile. You can run Docker after build.
I used Jenkins as the CI/CD tool during the deployment phase.
